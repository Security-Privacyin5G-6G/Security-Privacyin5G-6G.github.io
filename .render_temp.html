<h3 id="thesecurityandprivacyin5gand6gnetworks">The Security and Privacy in 5G and 6G networks</h3>
<p>The 5G network is under the deploying progress. However, the limitations of the 5G network are gradually being exposed. These limitations drive research on the 6G network. In order to meet the demands of the future internet, the 6G network needs to emerge from the traditional network architecture. Although there is already some research about the 6G network, the fundamental security and privacy problem of the 6G network still need further discussion. In this paper, we first review the previous network to find the trend of the 6G network. Then, we identify four key areas in the 6G network, then present some promising key technologies which may be used in the 6G network and the security and privacy issues inside theses technology. The applications of the 6G network are shown in the following. The intention of this article is to survey the new areas with their security and privacy challenges in the 6G network. This can lay the foundation for future security and privacy research in the 6G network.</p>
<h3 id="blockchainin5gand6gnetworks">Blockchain in 5G and 6G networks</h3>
<p>In 2008, Nakamoto presented the bitcoin, which is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that makes the public begin to pay attention to blockchain technology. Until now, blockchain technology is attracting massive attention and trigger multiple projects in different fields. The blockchain technology could help to do the business, government and logistic systems more reliable, trusty and safety. Moreover, recently, the combination of blockchain with 5G and 6G networks has attracted more and more attention. By implementing blockchain technology in 5G and 6G networks, some previously existing security and privacy issues can be solved well. Some blockchain-enabled technologies, applications and services in 5G and 6G networks need to be further discussed. </p>

<!--Like writing and speaking, software development is an act of human communication.
At its core,
the naturalness of software employs statistical modeling over big code to
reason about rich variety of programs developers write.  This new line of
research is inherently interdisciplinary, uniting the machine learning and
natural language processing communities with software engineering
and programming language communities.
