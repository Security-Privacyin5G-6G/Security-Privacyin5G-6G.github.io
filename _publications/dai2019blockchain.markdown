Blockchain and AI are promising techniques for next-generation wireless networks. Blockchain can establish a secure and decentralized resource sharing environment. AI can be explored to solve problems with uncertain, time-variant, and complex features. Both of these techniques have recently seen a surge in interest. The integration of these two techniques can further enhance the performance of wireless networks. In this article, we first propose a secure and intelligent architecture for next-generation wireless networks by integrating AI and blockchain into wireless networks to enable flexible and secure resource sharing. Then we propose a blockchain empowered content caching problem to maximize system utility, and develop a new caching scheme by utilizing deep reinforcement learning. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
