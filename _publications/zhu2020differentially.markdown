With the development of Cyber Physical Systems, privacy issues become an important topics in the past few years. It is worthwhile to apply differential privacy, one of the most influential privacy definitions, in cyber physical system. However, as the essential idea of differential privacy is to release query results rather than entire datasets, a large volume of noise has to be introduced. To provide high quality services we need to decrease the correlation between large sets of queries, while to predict on newly entered queries. This paper transfers the data publishing problem in cyber physical systems to a machine learning problem, in which a prediction model will be shared with clients. The predict model is used to answer current submitted queries and predict results for newly entered queries from the public.
