Visible light communication (VLC) is a promising solution to the increasing demands for
wireless connectivity. Gallium nitride micro-sized light emitting diodes (micro-LEDs) are
strong candidates for VLC due to their high bandwidths. Segmented violet micro-LEDs are
reported in this work with electrical-to-optical bandwidths up to 655 MHz. An orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing-based VLC system with adaptive bit and energy loading is
demonstrated, and a data transmission rate of 11.95 Gb/s is achieved with a violet micro
