Nearly every Integrated Development Environment includes a form of code completion. The suggested completions ("suggestions") are typically based on information available at compile time, such as type signatures and variables in scope. A statistical approach, based on estimated models of code patterns in large code corpora, has been demonstrated to be effective at predicting tokens given a context. In this demo, we present CACHECA, an Eclipse plugin that combines the native suggestions with a statistical suggestion regime. We demonstrate that a combination of the two approaches more than doubles Eclipseâ€™s suggestion accuracy.
