Differential privacy is an essential and prevalent privacy model that has been widely explored in recent decades. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of two research directions: differentially private data publishing and differentially private data analysis. We compare the diverse release mechanisms of differentially private data publishing given a variety of input data in terms of query type, the maximum number of queries, efficiency, and accuracy. We identify two basic frameworks for differentially private data analysis and list the typical algorithms used within each framework. The results are compared and discussed based on output accuracy and efficiency. Further, we propose several possible directions for future research and possible applications.
