This paper proposes a new conceptual architecture for authorization of mobile services based on blockchain technologies, and presents a design of procedures for heterogeneous mobile communication services. Furthermore, an extension of the procedures is considered in order to enhance privacy protection for users. The new architecture realizes the separation of mobile communication infrastructure and billing functions and multiple use of several mobile communication services under a single contract with a billing operator.
