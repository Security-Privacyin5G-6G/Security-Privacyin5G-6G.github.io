This paper presents a study of security advances and challenges associated with emergent 4G wireless technologies. The paper makes a number of contributions to the field. First, it studies the security standards evolution across different generations of wireless standards. Second, the security-related standards, architecture and design for the LTE and WiMAX technologies are analyzed. Third, security issues and vulnerabilities present in the above 4G standards are discussed. Finally, we point to potential areas for future vulnerabilities and evaluate areas in 4G security which warrant attention and future work by the research and advanced technology industry.
