Text  in  many  domains  involves  a  significant amount of named entities.   Predicting the entity names is often challenging
for a language model as they appear less
frequent  on  the  training  corpus.   In  this
paper,  we  propose  a  novel  and  effective
approach to building a discriminative language  model  which  can  learn  the  entity
names by leveraging their entity type information.  We also introduce two benchmark  datasets  based  on  recipes  and  Java
programming codes,  on which we evaluate the proposed model.  Experimental results show that our model achieves 52.2%
better perplexity in recipe generation and
22.06% on code generation than the state-of-the-art language models.
