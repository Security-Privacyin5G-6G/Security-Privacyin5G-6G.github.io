The proposed method describes the current forensics and biometrics in a modern approach and
implements the concept of IRIS along with brain and resolves the issues and increases the
strength of Digital Forensics Community. It has enormous features in biometrics to enhance
diverse security levels. A new method to identify individuals using IRIS Patterns with the brain
wave signals (EEG) is proposed. Several different algorithms were proposed for detecting,
verifying and extracting the deterministic patterns in a personâ€™s IRIS from the Eye. The extracted
EEG recordings form the person's brain has proved to be unique. Next we combine EEG signals
into the IRIS patterns a biometric application which makes use of future multi modal combination
architecture. The proposed forensic research directions and argues that to move forward the
community needs to adopt standardized, modular approaches for person identification. The result
of each authentication test is compared with the user's pre-recorded measurements, using
pattern recognition methods and signal-processing algorithms.
