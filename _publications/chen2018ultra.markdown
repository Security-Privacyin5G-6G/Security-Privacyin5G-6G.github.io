Mobile networking to achieve the ultra-low latency goal of 1 msec enables massive operation of autonomous vehicles and other intelligent mobile machines, and emerges as one of the most critical technologies beyond 5G mobile communications and state-of-the-art vehicular networks. Introducing fog computing and proactive network association, realizing virtual cell by integrating open-loop radio transmission and error control, and innovating anticipatory mobility management through machine learning, opens a new avenue toward ultra-low latency mobile networking.
