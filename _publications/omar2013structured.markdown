Statistical models of source code can be used to improve
code completion systems, assistive interfaces, and code
compression engines. We are developing a statistical model
where programs are represented as syntax trees, rather than
simply a stream of tokens. Our model, initially for the Java
language, combines corpus data with information about syntax, types and the program context. We tested this model
using open source code corpuses and find that our model
is significantly more accurate than the current state of the
art, providing initial evidence for our claim that combining
structural and statistical information is a fruitful strategy.
