Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become alternative approaches in wireless networks
beside conventional approaches such as model based solution
concepts. Whereas traditional design concepts include the modelling of the behaviour of the underlying processes, AI based
approaches allow to design network functions by learning from
input data which is supposed to get mapped to specific outputs
(training). Additionally, new input/output relations can be learnt
during the deployement phase of the function (online learning)
and make AI based solutions flexible, in order to react to new
situations. Especially, new introduced use cases such as Ultra
Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) and Massive
Machine Type Communications (MMTC) in 5G make this approach necessary, as the network complexity is further enhanced
compared to networks mainly designed for human driven traffic
(4G, 5G xMBB). The focus of this paper is to illustrate exemplary
applications of AI techniques at the Physical Layer (PHY) of
future wireless systems and therfore they can be seen as candidate
technologies for e.g. 6G systems.
