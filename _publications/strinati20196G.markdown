The current development of 5G networks represents a breakthrough in the design of communication networks, for its ability to provide a single platform enabling a variety of different services, from enhanced mobile broadband communications, automated driving, Internet-of-Things, with its huge number of connected devices, etc. Nevertheless, looking at the current development of technologies and new services, it is already possible to envision the need to move beyond 5G with a new architecture incorporating new services and technologies. The goal of this paper is to motivate the need to move to a sixth generation (6G) of mobile communication networks, starting from a gap analysis of 5G, and predicting a new synthesis of near future services, like hologram interfaces, ambient sensing intelligence, a pervasive introduction of artificial intelligence and the incorporation of technologies, like TeraHertz (THz) or Visible Light Communications (VLC), 3-dimensional coverage.
