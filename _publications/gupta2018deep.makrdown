Novice programmers often struggle with the formal
syntax of programming languages.  To assist them,
we design a novel programming language correction  framework  amenable  to  reinforcement  learning.  The framework allows an agent to mimic human  actions  for  text  navigation  and  editing.   We
demonstrate that the agent can be trained through
self-exploration directly from the raw input, that is,
program text itself, without any knowledge of the
formal syntax of the programming language.   We
leverage expert demonstrations for one tenth of the
training data to accelerate training.  The proposed
technique  is  evaluated  on 6975
erroneous  C  programs with typographic errors, written by students
during an introductory programming course.  Our
technique fixes 14%
more programs and 29% more
compiler error messages relative to those fixed by
a state-of-the-art tool, DeepFix, which uses a fully
supervised neural machine translation approach.
