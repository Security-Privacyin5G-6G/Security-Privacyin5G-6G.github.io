Requirements for 5G mobile networks includes a higher flexibility, scalability, cost effectiveness and energy efficiency. Towards these goals, Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization have been adopted in recent proposals for future mobile networks architectures because they are considered critical technologies for 5G. In this paper, we propose an X2-based handover implementation in an SDN-based and partially virtualized LTE architecture. Moreover, the architecture considered operates at link level, which provides lower latency and higher scalability. In our implementation, we use MPLS tunnels for user plane instead of GTP-U protocol, which introduces a significant overhead. To verify the correct operation of our system, we developed a simulator. It implements the messages exchange and processing of the primary network entities. Using this tool we measured the handover preparation and completion times, whose estimated values were roughly 6.94 ms and 8.31 ms, respectively, according to our experimental setup. These latencies meet the expected requirements concerning control plane delay budgets for 5G networks.
