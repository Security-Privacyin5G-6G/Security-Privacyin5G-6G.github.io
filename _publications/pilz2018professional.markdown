The fifth generation of cellular mobile communication networks is on the horizon and aims to integrate new vertical markets. In this article, we discuss professional wireless audio systems used for live productions as a future use case for 5G. Wireless live audio productions require high communication reliability as well as ultra-low signal delay. Furthermore, these services demand strict synchronization of devices to function properly. The need for low latency and for precise time and phase synchronization goes beyond what is currently under discussion in the context of URLLC. We seize on this aspect, discuss how isochronous data transmission can be implemented and integrated into 5G networks, and show similarities with other 5G verticals such as industrial automation.
