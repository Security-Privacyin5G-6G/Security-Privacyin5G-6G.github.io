5G wireless communications technology is being launched, with many smart applications being integrated. However, 5G specifications meagre the requirements of new emerging technologies forcefully. These include data rate, capacity, latency, reliability, resources sharing, and energy/bit. To meet these challenging demands, research is focusing on 6G wireless communications enabling different technologies and emerging new applications. In this paper, the latest research work on 6G technologies and applications is summarized, and the associated research challenges are discussed.
