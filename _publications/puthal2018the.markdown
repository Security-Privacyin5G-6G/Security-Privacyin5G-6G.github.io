The blockchain is emerging as one of the most propitious and ingenious technologies of cybersecurity. In its germinal state, the technology has successfully replaced economic transaction systems in various organizations and has the potential to revamp heterogeneous business models in different industries. Although it promises a secure distributed framework to facilitate sharing, exchanging, and the integration of information across all users and third parties, it is important for the planners and decision makers to analyze it in depth for its suitability in their industry and business applications. The blockchain should be deployed only if it is applicable and provides security with better opportunities for obtaining increased revenue and reductions in cost. This article presents an overview of this technology for the realization of security across distributed parties in an impregnable and transparent way.
