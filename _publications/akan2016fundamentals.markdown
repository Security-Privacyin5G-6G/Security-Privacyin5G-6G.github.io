Molecular communication (MC) is the most promising communication paradigm for nanonetwork realization since it is a natural phenomenon observed among living entities with nanoscale components. Since MC significantly differs from classical communication systems, it mandates reinvestigation of information and communication theoretical fundamentals. The closest examples of MC architectures are present inside our own body. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the existing literature on intrabody nanonetworks and different MC paradigms to establish and introduce the fundamentals of molecular information and communication science. We highlight future research directions and open issues that need to be addressed for revealing the fundamental limits of this science. Although the scope of this development encompasses wide range of applications, we particularly emphasize its significance for life sciences by introducing potential diagnosis and treatment techniques for diseases caused by dysfunction of intrabody nanonetworks.
